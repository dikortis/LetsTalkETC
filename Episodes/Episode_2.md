# Let's Talk ETC: Developers featuring Elaine Ou.
**Carlo Vicari:**
hi everyone and thank you for tuning in
you're listening to episode 2 of let's
talk ETS i'm your host Carlovy along
with my co-host dr. Christian Severino
also i want to make a special point
tonight and thank the ETS developers
for working on this project Christian
and I you know we're in touch with the
community an awful lot but it's really
the devs that are kind of the engine the
oil the tires you know everything that
drives this project forward and it's
such an exciting way to such exciting
times so I just wanted to make a special
point about thanking them for everything
they do and also that kind of segues us
into the next topic for tonight we have
a special guest with us ETC developer
Elaine why don't you just
introduce yourself to everybody and also
thanks so much for everything you've
done with for the ETC community and the
eegees project

**Elaine:**
 sure hi but thanks for
having me on I'm you know excited to be
here and I'm glad to see so much support
for ETC I mean you give the devs a
lot of credit but I think really it's
the community and the people who build
apps for ETC that will go actually give
it value

**Carlo Vicari:**
 yes very true so
let's also I'd like to thank the
ETC community along with all the
developers and you know everyone that's
participating in this project you
know that's across the globe there's
just so much support and I guess we
can you know talk a little bit about ETC
newsletter that it was just released
and talk about some of the stuff in the
development report on there it's you
know great to have a one of you guys on
so that we can get into a little bit
more depth of what's going on

**Elaine:**
 sure
should I good

**Carlo Vicari:**
 Yes I guess some I
know we were talking earlier you were
telling me and Christian about you know
some of the stuff going on in the dev
report like parody and f qor and stuff
like that

Elaine:
 yes so previously we had
updated go athyrium client to delay the
bomb and now parody are the earth core
team has accepted our treat but the same
changes for the parody client and right
now parody is the most popular client in
84 ETS so bi our january hard fork
everyone should have the update client
with the bomb delay and it's great that
math core has been so supportive of our
changes and willing to accommodate us
and me for that matter you know the rest
of the ethereum developers have also
provided a lot of technical support in
helping us get everything stabilized

**Carlo Vicari:**
cool

**Elaine:**
yes I saw something 

**Carlo Vicari:**
yes
definitely Christian go ahead

**Christian Seberino:**
 okay
well first of all I didn't know what
Alain just said I'm very glad that she's
getting support from the ethereum
developers and but I did have one
question that might help some people
listening so I was reading about in the
dev report and in this link this paper
that is in the dev report called it
ethereum classic fundamentals and if you
read this and you read what the
developers are doing i could imagine
some people thinking holy moly if I'm
not a genius I can't contribute and I
you guys picked up the the clients
midstream and you guys are now you
know working on them you remove the dow
issues and i was just wondering what
would you say to somebody that maybe is
not you know the greatest developer in
the world but they want to contribute
you have to be a genius to help you guys


**Elaine:**
well of course not i mean i don't think
any of the current ETС developers
were familiar with rust which is the
programming language used for parody
prior to
diving in and splitsville Igor has done
a great job with that but the community
is really supportive and but the client
code bases are pretty big they've been
working on it for like two years now so
it's impossible to expect anyone to jump
in and instantly be familiar with it
everything so the community is
supportive and it's easy to get help and
get questions answered

**Christian Seberino:**
 okay great I know
that I've heard here and there that like
for example to in contrast the the Linux
kernel development those guys have been
using see forever and I heard that if
you ask a dumb question on the colonel
list that they pretty much chew you up
but that sounds like what you're saying
is the ETCdevs the you guys aren't like
that so it more welcoming is that right



**Elaine:**
yes I don't have much I mean I don't
have any expand experience them
contributing to the Linux kernel but i
mean i've heard mixed stories about that
but regardless over here everyone
is you know very patient and will I
answer dumb questions

**Christian Seberino:**
 okay

**Carlo Vicari:**
 yes
I've definitely had my fair share of
those kind of being uh in the non tech
side of these things but you know
everybody even from day one has
just been so supportive throughout the
whole community and you know I always
post a like a community poll to just to
see how everybody's communicating and
getting along and stuff like that and it
seems like everything is doing really
well so far which is great and also I
guess this kind of can bring us into our
next topic as far as a community support
and stuff like that you know big
semi announcement nothing official but
from the ICO of btcc originally it
started out as that coin Telegraph
article which was kind of just like a
little bit of a rumor mill but then he
came out and confirmed on Twitter I
don't know if you guys saw this he said
it quote uh it's something we plan to do
no time frame yet and
so the Twittersphere is going nuts with
that one it's it's pretty awesome what
do you guys think Lane I guess you can
give us your thoughts on that



**Elaine:**
yes when I went to Shanghai two months
ago I was surprised that like how big
the community support was over in China
because I hadn't really been in touch
with that part of the community at all
but it seems like there's a lot more
support for ETC over there than here
in the states and it's great to hear
that btcc will be supporting if you're
in classic and I here are not the
other one which one


**Carlo Vicari:**
 I'm sorry 

**Elaine:**
think they're only going to support one


**Carlo Vicari:**
yes that's what it looks
like now I the we chat is kind
of still buzzing about what's going on
with that for you guys listening out
there who don't know what I meant by
that we kind of have a lot of our
discussions amongst the North American
and European counterparts take place you
know on slack and read it and stuff like
that but a lot of the Asian community
they really communicate a lot through
the we chat group that's on for
ethereum classic so what do you think
Krisha I mean I know you've probably
been in touch with some people about
this and you've got a lot of community
response about education it's pretty
cool how much the Asian community is
into what we've got going on


**Christian Seberino:**
 yes
I contacted by somebody that wanted to
translate some of my educational
materials which and that I wasn't
expecting that and edit stuff he even
showed me some Chinese web page which of
course I couldn't read but he said
you got all these people reading
your stuff on this website so i thought
off to take your word for it because i
have no clue what it says and how to
find out so that was pretty cool well i
had a question for Elena I don't know if
you could answer this but
you said that the Asian community has
what is supporting et see more do you
have any idea why that is the case is
there some cultural reason that makes
them more attractive ETC or is it
something else

**Elaine:**
 um well i don't know if
they're necessarily supporting ETC
more you know versus like other chains
like ethereum I think that their support
is just greater relative to what we
might see over here in North America and
I mean it's possible that they're just
more people using digital currency over
there are more people interested in
digital currency over there

**Christian Seberino:**
 okay


**Carlo Vicari:**
 yes
I think you know the digital currency
or cryptocurrency blockchains in general
just have kind of a different value
proposition over there they're
they're pretty seems like they're pretty
hyped about the possible how heavily the
community is leaving leaning towards cap
regarding regards to the monetary policy
some what else can you tell us
about your trip I know you had a couple
of meetups over there and you were kind
of you know I think he went to Def Con
and a whole bunch of other cool stuff


**Elaine:**
 I didn't exceed our def con  I
only went for the UTC meet up

**Carlo Vicari:**
 that's
right red and what was up what was that
made up like I know we tried to stream
it but the stream drop because there
were too many people trying to watch
their was like 3500 people I'm trying to
watch a stream at the time it went


**Elaine:**
well I met Roy who is  I guess
leading the Chinese speaking community
over there for ETC I got to learn a
bit about like BTCC and how they make
decisions about what I guess coins to
list on their exchanges and  I'm
guessing that one of the main concerns
that they have right now regarding ETC
or ethereum
is that the clients are still for the
blockchains are still a little bit
unstable and subject to multiple Forks

**Carlo Vicari:**
yes I know what you mean I'm
glad we're taking kind of a security
first approach to things as opposed to
move fast break things which is a little
bit of a different mantra so I'm glad
 we're taking that approach
Christian I want to ask you also about
just along those lines with the the
unstable pneus of the chains potentially
and what we're going forward with
security first and kind of how that
plays into the the Asian community
international community in North
American South American European
communities going forward for ETC

**Christian Seberino:**
yes I think I can feel their pain as a
famous politician said I nobody likes
hard forks and so if there's people in
the Asian community that aren't too
happy about that but it's really no I'm
sure Elaine would agree that you just
there's nothing you could do about
certain sometimes you have to
hard fork the denial of service
vulnerabilities we have to hard for it
there's just no way around that the way
this will all play out hopefully is that
we will get most of the hard Forks out
of the way now and then going forward
they'll and less it may
be eventually you know one every couple
years if that and that's just the
nature of software I'm hoping that
that's how it turns out that's what I'm
gonna suming is gonna happen

**Carlo Vicari:**
 that's true
I think even the way the last hard fork
went that we did that was for a protocol
update was really smooth so as
long as we continue to update the code
base and do protocol Forks or protocol
updates really they are since I think
fork kind of implies that it's
contentious but this one wasn't
contentious at all because no one stayed
on the vulnerable chain since it was
protocol update so I think as long as
going forward we stick to purely
protocol updates we really won't have
too many issues as far as contention and
and discussion or not discussion but
stuff like that goes it won't be like
the the Dow debacle or anything like
that what do you think Elaine

**Elaine:**
 well
bitcoin is facing a protocol update
right now regarding the block size and I
mean we're lucky now in that our
community is still fairly small and we
are all fairly aligned in our goals I
think as as the community gets bigger
there might be more contention over
protocol updates because people will
have different priorities for what ETC
should be good at  my preference
is to get all the protocol updates and
hard Forks out of the way early on and
just have something stable for longer
term


**Carlo Vicari:**
 yeS very true very true so I
think that's a you know pretty pretty
good discussion that we had about the
BTC and the ICO and the coin Telegraph
article I guess is kind of encompassed
on that I had to make a go ahead



**Christian Seberino:**
okay so it there's at
least two reasons why a hard fork could
be a bad thing so one of them is
definitely if there's a huge
disagreements in the community but you
didn't quite it didn't seem like you
saw that even some people changes
annoying even if there's
complete agreement you have to update
your clients you have to do and some
people just rather not have to deal with
any of that so even if ever there's
agreement people still don't necessarily
say okay the hard fork as much as you
want so

**Carlo Vicari:**
 that's true okay

**Elaine:**
 well I'm glad
really good especially for exchanges who
you know I have to who are securing like
a huge amount of ethereum ETC
have to be able to update securely

**Carlo Vicari:**
 yes
very true um I got a chance to speak to
some of the people from exchanges over
at COIN agenda and they expressed a lot
of that same sentiment about not
necessarily whether it's contentious are
not contentious it's just a pain in the
neck for them all together whether
whether it was all agreed upon or not so
that's very true so
also there was also another thing from
the recent news letter was an article
from Rocky from by rocky from Krypto
hustle I don't know if you got a chance
to see that Christian or what was going
on with that article

**Christian Seberino:**
 yes

**Carlo Vicari:**
 for anybody
out there who didn't get a chance to
read Christian can tell you guys about
it you guys should definitely check it
out it's in the newsletter which we will
post a link to the newsletter in the
description if you're watching on
YouTube in the description below we'll
have a link to the newsletter


**Christian Seberino:**
 yes in
summary a rocky who describes himself as
a full-time crypto currency trader
investor and analyst so he decide okay I
better check out ETC if it's something
I want to park some money in and he
apparently is bullish on ETC and
he wrote a paper describing why he
thinks there's happy times ahead and he
goes into detail he must have really
done his homework because he knows a lot
of names of the developers there's a lot
of facts and figures in here so the
developers have their act together and
then he talks about barry silbert as a
investment trust and they're they're
working on the monetary policy and
anyway so he just makes his case why
he's a fan of ETC an investor

**Carlo Vicari:**
 yes
I'm not sure if you got a chance to
check that check out that article did
you uh Elaine I know you're busy doing a
whole bunch of a million things so not
sure if you get a chance to check that
up oh

**Elaine:**
 I heard it pretty quickly and I
thought like most or pretty much
everything was
fairly accurate and I would  I
mean I agree with everything that he
said regarding you know how with ethereum
classic formed and its fundamentals

**Carlo Vicari:**
 yes
Rocky's been  he's already put
out a couple of articles for for
relative to ETC and talking about the
community so shout out to rocky for
representing ETC especially when
there's so many hit pieces that have
come out against us from a couple of
different news sources so I'm
happy for rocky and crypto hustle to be
able to get the facts out there about
what the ETC community and the ETC
development community has been doing and
working on the project 


**Christian Seberino:**
why I
caught so what go ahead yet one thing I
got from rockys paper this is part of
one of the reasons why i asked Elaine if
you had to be a genius to support the
community he really he just goes on and
on about how great the developers are
and you read about the Igor art 2mon off
and you'd think that this guy was just a
you know a tank development machine
because it just he goes there's a
paragraph about how he just really took
over a lot of responsibilities leading a
lot of work and you're just like holy
moly man these guys are amazing



**Carlo Vicari:**
definitely it's for anyone listening
that has seen the username splits out
there on splits that would be Igor for
anyone out there listening that's
interested kind of wants to put the
username with the actual name so what
I know you've done a bunch of work
probably with Igor and stuff like that
Elaine so what do you what's the dynamic
between you guys like I don't know if
it's something you guys work together or
it's kind of just like an independent
thing going 

**Elaine:**
on well first of all Igor is
legitimately a tank and a coding machine
like but to this point like most
development work has been done
sort of independently with a little bit
of communication on github when we open
issues or do pull requests and the
conversation on github is open to the
public so like even if someone from the
community doesn't actually want to like
dive into the code they can still
monitor like what the issues are and
what changes are being made and they're
welcome to comment on them so what
we've been doing so far has been fairly
unstructured


**Carlo Vicari:**
 got you absolutely
in reference to the participation so in
the newsletter guys that's in the
description if you're watching this on
youtube there's a going to be a link to
a call to action post from our reddit
that has all the information about how
you can join and participate on github
and stuff like that so uh you know we've
discussed a lot about ETC and
something that our viewers are
interested in is as much as I like to
talk about 80 °c and what's going on in
the community we are all major
proponents of blockchain and block train
in general and what's going on so
because the recent hype has been
recently about all the Zcash stuff so
not that any of us here know a whole
bunch of what's going on with that but
just a couple of opinions on what's
going on with Zcash and the whole
launch of that if you guys have any
opinions on it what's going on just a
couple of brief thoughts if


**Christian Seberino:**
 yes I so
I was the process of researching this so
it's timely that you asked so there's
been some new advances in cryptography
that can provide a privacy that they
help with privacy concerns and so
Zuko has he's leading this Zcash
project I remember there was some other
project unrelated I remember talking to
him years and years ago on another peer
to peer community and so he's just taken
the lead
this but yes I'm just excited to see
how this whole zero-knowledge proof
business plays out if it gives everybody
you know the privacy that that zuko
claims it does i think that would be
great what

**Carlo Vicari:**
 do you think Elena 

**Elaine:**
yes I
think I mean the technology behind see
cash and ZK snarks has the potential to
be very interesting and I know that
bitcoin is currently looking at ways to
better preserve the privacy of their
transactions and it's probably something
that ETC might even want to consider
in the future I mean this might not be
the most scalable solution but I mean
something we should think about and I
think Zcash got a lot of unnecessary
grief because of the way they set up
there you know for-profit corporation
and got venture funding and I think that
distracts a lot from the actual
technology behind Zcash because I mean
eight it hasn't I mean it's very
interesting probably fewer than a dozen
people on a planet actually know how ck
snarks work so it would be great if
people paid more attention to the actual
protocol instead of how they set up
their corporation

**Carlo Vicari:**
 yes I agree
absolutely understand what you're saying
and stuff like that and there was a lot
of discussion about this and slack and
people were actually discussing I don't
know if you saw it ethereum ninja and a
couple of other people were discussing
about Lakeman arrow and relay between
that and ETC and a whole bunch of other
stuff not sure if you got a chance to
see that Elena 
you should
check that out it was pretty interesting
conversation I didn't get to go too in
depth into it but I know a lot of people
were or not a lot of people but a few
people were discussing about mineiro and
between us and monaro and z cash and BTW
see all sorts of stuff like
and Christian actually did you get a
chance to see that conversation that was
going on in sly


**Christian Seberino:**
 no I could be that
specific conversation that you're
talking about but I did have another
comment about this this move towards
initiatives regarding privacy it just
seems like the inevitable or natural
progression first Satoshi showed that
block chains work and then right
metallic said okay let's make a an even
more powerful scripting language and
then that seems to be working so then
people look around and say okay what
else can I do now okay let's add privacy
it's so it just seems like the
inevitable progression of cryptocurrency
22 now add this this new feature on top
of what we've already established



**Carlo Vicari:**
it's definitely evolving
that's for sure it feels like um you
know every every year that goes by these
chains evolved the way that like an
organism does so I read a few articles
that kind of talk about that and I kind
of agree it's such an interesting thing
to look at the way that these chains you
know break and change and evolve and all
these ideas are constantly progressing
at such a rapid rate 

**Christian Seberino:**
yes maybe if
somebody has a different viewpoint maybe
they could add a comment but if given a
choice between you know having privacy
or not having privacy it would seem to
me that in the future people's I'll just
have privacy just to be safe and so it
would seem that pretty much you know
privacy protecting crypto currencies are
going to dominate in the future I don't
see why that wouldn't be the case

**Carlo Vicari:**
very true and i guess like gullane
said in reference to the ZK snarks would
you say la there's probably like less
than two dozen or dozen people that
really get what's going on with ZK
snarks and how the technology works

**Elaine:**
 yes
there was a call from I mean it's posted
on YouTube somewhere where Zuko was at a
meet up and someone asked him to explain
how zero knowledge proofs work and he
said
something to the effect of you know to
be honest I don't actually really know
how they work  that's reassuring
there probably aren't enough people
out there who understand how it works
but it was the same case with you know
blockchain in general when tires
when it first came out and let Nick
no one understood it but eventually a
lot of people understood it

**Carlo Vicari:**
agreed I know exactly what you mean it's
kind of just the natural progression of
technology even going past before
blockchain if you look at you know a
standard computer there is just a very
few people I guess initially that even
understood what was going on or the
implications so 

**Christian Seberino:**
I can make it one more
comment 

**Carlo Vicari:**
yes go ahead definitely


**Christian Seberino:**
 and so
what Zuko is doing is not of course the
only way to provide privacy some of the
other cryptocurrencies they a simplified
method simplified description they're
basically mixing a lot of people's
transactions together and it all comes
out fine at the end but the idea is to
confuse everything in the middle so much
that you can't trace it back so in an
oversimplified nutshell that's that's
another big way that people are trying
to establish privacy crypto currencies


**Carlo Vicari:**
definitely i I've you know
I've read about the mixing and stuff
like that and the ring signatures as
well I've read a little bit about
although I don't know too much about it
so in reference to this is kind of a
little bit of a derailment on what we've
been talking about but I wanted to bring
it up because it's an important thing
for anybody that's listening out there
that wants to participate in something
we have going on in the community so I
don't know if you guys saw this or maybe
Elaine saw or just christian in
reference to the wikipedia page that
right now if you wikipedia ethereum
classic it redirects you to ethereum
currently so I don't know if you guys
saw this but inside the newsletter i put
a kind of a call to action
to help with that Wikipedia page for
anybody who wants to help out with
structuring that or adding information
or citations and I spoke with some of
the guys over in Wikipedia in the chat
and they recommended what some other
people were recommending which was we
need to add citations and add
information inside the actual ethereum
page to the point where it's so
comprehensive that then will kind of be
promoted in a way to our own ethereum
classic page on Wikipedia so I don't
know if you saw that Elaine

**Elaine:**
 yes
I think that's a great idea but we could
pretty much take like Rocky's whole
article and just paste it in right


**Carlo Vicari:**
yes it was a that was a
great article and we've got a ton of
other articles and another a ton of
other info too so Christian did you see
that on unread it as well

**Christian Seberino:**
 yes I did and
my thought 11 encouraging thing was
that for anybody that wants to
contribute this is really like the the
ground floor I mean if if people are
putting up the the first ETC
Wikipedia page you know clearly where
this is going to get in the developers
are getting you know organizing getting
the systems in place and so in a couple
years everybody everything will be
perfectly set Morgan now that everything
is kind of theirs churn this is a great
time to get in to help out

**Carlo Vicari:**
 the wikipedia
page would be really great too um since
you're also an educator Christian as an
educational resource to just be able to
once we have it comprehensive enough to
be able to just kind of point people in
that direction for a lot of different
questions that they have about what's
going on in the community or where we
were where we are currently or where
we're going so I'm pretty excited about
getting that off the ground and getting
a lot of contributions from the general
community and getting that together so
we that'll be another great educational
resource for us to point people in

**Christian Seberino:**
 yes

**Carlo Vicari:**
 very cool so
I think that pretty much covers it as
far as the newsletter goes and guys
anybody listening out there that there's
any questions you have or anything you'd
like us to touch upon or talk about in
the next podcast let us know if you're
watching on YouTube we're listening on
YouTube leave it in the comments section
below and we'll definitely be able to
bring that up in the next podcast
l'ainte anything else you guys want to
talk about or touch on so
again I'd like to thank you guys for
being on here with me Christian thanks
again for helping me out co-hosting the
show and special thanks to you Elaine
it's great to have a dev on here and
thank you to the you know entire
ethereum classic community the ETC
community and the development community
that's been helping out with this
project so much so thank you guys for
joining thank you everybody for
listening and looking forward to next
week which same time same place we're
going to be doing this show seven thirty
eastern standard time we're going to try
to have a guest on every week as well as
hit s'amuser questions for anybody who
post them in the comments below

**Christian Seberino:**
so good 

**Carlo Vicari:**
all right excellent guys
take Caroline thanks later Christian
take care my guess
